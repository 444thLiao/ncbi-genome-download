# NCBI Genome Downloading Scripts

Some script to download bacterial and fungal genomes from NCBI after they
restructured their FTP a while ago.

Idea shamelessly stolen from [Mick Watson's Kraken downloader
scripts](http://www.opiniomics.org/building-a-kraken-database-with-new-ftp-structure-and-no-gi-numbers/)
that can also be found in [Mick's GitHub
repo](https://github.com/mw55309/Kraken_db_install_scripts). However, Mick's
scripts are ~~written in Perl~~ specific to actually building a Kraken database
(as advertised).

So this is a set of scripts that focuses on the actual genome downloading.
